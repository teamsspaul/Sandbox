To run, put Display_Doubles.py in the same folder as the double matrix (FastTap should put it in the GET_RATES folder).

Make sure there is only one doubles matrix file in the directory
 (won't have to worry about this unless you are moving doubles matrix files...which have really long names)

Go to line 390, and thats where you group the detectors....run the code.

The directory I sent should already have all you need to run the code for testing



Two output plots as well as two output excel sheets should show up. 

There are two sets because one is 
for symmetric data (example: all doubles between detectors 1 and 2) and one is for assymmetric 
data (example: doubles where 1 opened the gate and 2 'closed' the gate are distinct from doubles 
where 2 opened the gate and 1 'closed' the gate)


The excel sheets should provide more information where as the plots are pretty.
